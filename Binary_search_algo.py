"""
Create a random list of numbers between 0 and 100 with a difference of 2 between each number. 
Ask the user for a number between 0 and 100 to check whether their number is in the list. 
The programme should work like this. The programme will half the list of numbers and see whether 
the users number matches the middle element in the list. If they do not match, the programme will 
check which half the number lies in, and eliminate the other half. The search then continues on the 
remaining half, again checking whether the middle element in that half is equal to the userâ€™s number. 
This process keeps on going until the programme finds the users number, or until the size of the 
subarray is 0, which means the users number isn't in the list.
